Piaget developed _Genetic Epistemology_. It declares that the interaction of organism and environment is based on _Self-Regulation_, focused on _Scheme_ and _Concept_.

Cognition of human is called _Scheme_ by Piaget. Which is also called _Representation_.

- Assimilation: organism integrate external environment (modify perceptual) into its _Scheme_.
- Accommodation: organism adjust its _Scheme_ to adapt external environment.
- Equilibrium: organism use _Scheme_ to explain and react internal environment, until **external**, which failed to counteract and in disequilibrium.

This suggests that the factor effect organism is:

- biological development of organism.
- cognition experience or _scheme_ formed in brain.
- environment, especially society for human.

Piaget then developed the basic verb of _Scheme_, _Operation_.

Like group:
- internal, mental logic verb.
- reversible.
- identity in reversible.

Stage:

- Sensor Motor Stage: hybrid of selfness and environment, react by sensor of stimulation. 
- Preoperational stage: 
  - Symbol: Figure out symbol and identification between symbol and thing
  - Intuitive: No reversibility in operation.
- Concrete Operational Stage: operation in concrete experience support.
- Formal Operational Stage: operation in logical and formal.

Vygotsky suggests that, formal or scientific knowledge is from abstract to concrete, and daily knowledge is from concrete to abstract, they interleave each other and the cognition of children is back and forth between them.

Thus, culture and society background should aid up children, the gap of what can children do solely and what can children do with aid is called _Zone of Proximal Development_. Thus adults, teacher and near company should provide scaffolding in correct (Proximal Zone) stage, to help children.

Student learns based on the already acquianted knowledge. Learning process is to assimilate the external concepts into internal or accommodate previous concepts to adapt the external concepts, assemble relations.

Student need to evaluate itself and reconstruct ideas in relation of society, then apply and reevaluate again in new environment or situation.

This comes with the learning principle:

- Given knowledge should be connected with fresh, core, conditional knowledge.
- Self-Evaluation in society, communication, feedback.
- Establish interests and assessment depended on the trait of various students.
- Applied in reality.

That's a knowledge-centered, stduent communication/assessment-centered.

In comtemporary soceity, the definition of _cirriculum_ is changing, but it's the summary of interaction and activity of 
learner in its environment.

_Physics Curriculum_ is based on the sequential learning process:
- experiment
- thinking, summary of principles, mathematics
- application in real environment

We should achieve such cultivation target:
- experiment observation and evaluation
- logical and analysis thinking
- mathematics ability

Thus, physics curriculum is with below content:
- based on experiment observation and evaluation
- supported by logical, systematic analysis and distill limited but extendable knowledge.
- apply in reality and inquiry.

_Instructional Process_ is the process of learning in guidance of external environment, for example, teacher.

Such cognition process has its particularity:
- indirection
- guidance
- concise
- sequential

Thus based on this we have such trait in physics curriculum to achieve cultivation target:
- experiments
- logical process and structure knowledge in thinking cultivation
- independent exploration and cultivate interests
- application in reality

_Instruction Principle_ is the basis demand of teaching reflecting the regulation of teaching.

The above target is also the principle we should follow:
- scientific foundation
- experiment and inquiry
- process and analysis
- cultivate interest and application in reality

Which is almost same.

With factor below:

- Teacher
- Student
- Instruction Method
- Instruction Content

_Instruction Method_ is the teaching operation applied in _Instructional Process_.

- Lecture
- FAQ
- Communication
- Experiment
- Situation inquiry

The whole process of method can be summarized as creating _Discrepant Event_ to stimulate interest, student will raise answer based on previous, daily experience, which is _Engagement_ and _Exploration_; therefore, teacher will explore various situations and simplify, distill the core concept from them, which is _Explanation_ and _Elaboration_; finally, teacher will guide studuent to apply concepts to reality, which is _Evaluation_.

We should analyze the current environment and resource to dynamically apply various methods.

_Instructional Strategy_ is the interaction activity to guide student in the planned _Instructional Process_.

- Teamwork
- Error Correction
- Prediction,Observation,Explanation
- FAQ
- Application in Real Situation/Solve Real Problems
- Role Play

### Core Attainment of Physics Education

- Physical Idea: the basic understanding of dynamics and principle of physics.

- Scientific Thinking: The ability of construction abstract model and thereby doubt and criticize different views, conclusions by analysis, deduction application. Thus understanding the _Physical Idea_ and attain the innovation ability.

- Scientific Inquiry: Inquiry by observation and experiment, forming conjecture and hypothesis, design experiment and acquiring information thereby evaluate and reflect.

- Scientific Attitude and Responsibility: Internal motivation and interests; serious and consistent attitude; promote sustainable development and ethical standards.
