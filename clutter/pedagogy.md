## Investigation

### Educational Scheme
- Dual
- Single
- Branch(Ours)

Trend: 
- quality
- age limit: preschool/lifelong 
- open, diverse

### Course

Contemporarily, the construction of course is the summation of content, process throughout various subject, activity.

1. Subject/Experience: specific knowledge field/interest and experience
2. Branch/Integration: single subject/multiple, project based
3. obvious/potential: planed, official designed/unexpected, concrete process established, values, knowledge, discipline. Companied, interconversion.

**Course Plan/Scheme/Frame**: The guiding design of education by country, based on objective and tasks.

**Course Standard**: The programme of specific course by country which is implementation of _Course Plan_.

Thus based on it, we form a hierarchy from country -> locale -> school.

Trend:
- Country/Locale parallel
- high tech/self experience
- diverse
- teacher development
- science

_The eighth course reform_: aims for nationality and every students.

_Core Attainment_:

- Self
	- learning
	- Health
- Society
	- Responsibility: ideology
	- Practise and innovation
- Culture
    - humanity
    - science, criticize

## Education

From above, we can summarize that contemporary education still focus on four factor:
- educator
- learner
- content(**Course Plan**, **Course Standard** **Text book**, potential: values etc...)
- method: the material media of content or form of teaching.

It mostly focus on _official education_, but _unofficial education_ is also exist as the learning process reflected in culture, daily, production.

## Teaching

Teaching is the activity of interaction between teacher and students in education factor and trait:
- indirect
- guidance
- clear/simple

(Ours), basic task is: moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetics, labour.
(knowledge/skill) -> (intellectual/physcal) -> (moral/aesthetics)

(Ours): principle from _Core Attainment_:
- ideology guidance
- gradual learning
- diversity
- ethic: respect choice and development of children.

From Course Standard, teacher need to design and implement a whole teaching process.
- Prepare
  - Course Standard/Text book
  - text book analysis -> design qualified content -> distill perspective and connotation -> achieve target
  - understand students knowledge level.
- Teaching
- Assign and correct homework
- Assessment

**Teaching Method**: in common(teacher and student) teaching process, apply certain method to achieve target.

**Teaching Organization**: in common(...) teaching process, organize in different structure to achieve target.

**Assessment**:
- Relative/Absolute: standard defined in the applied group, and measure relative position/presumed standard, independent to applied group but only depended on ability of trial subjects.

diagnostic -> feedback -> management and dispatch -> guidance

## Individual

- Genetic -> Growth -> Acquired -> self-consciousness
- environment as various condition depended on individual interacted with individual

Education in individual:
- individualization: act by oneself conscisousness -> respect difference -> difference as a individual process and innovation
- socialization: identification consciousness -> acquired social consciousness -> skill -> character

Unified in society practise as two side of coin.

## Society

Now we can summarize above that education can be decomposed to material development, Aims(society property), structure/organization, knowledge spectrum.

- Production
  - meterial development
  - aims
  - organization
  - knowledge spectrum
- Politics
  - determines property as aims
  - organization as educational rights
  - organization as management
- Population
  - quantity affect material development
  - quantity affect aims as future resource dispatch
  - quality affect organization as level of education
  - age structure/employment structure ...
- Culture
  - material development
  - aims
  - knowledge spectrum

Education can affect reversely.

- Culture
  - inheritance
  - selection in development
  - communication
  - innovation
