Realizing Reason(Abbr. RR). Macbeth describes three stages of cognition for world. First is ancient greek. It claims that *cognition* is a perception ability owned by reason animal. Thus thought relates to object through perception. Thus cognition and perception are form a mixture. For greeks, the problem is why perception can't _perceive_ properly rather why perception can _perceive_ succesfully. For example, math is a transcendent(rather Kant terminology, over-perception) object.

Therefore in second stage, Paradiagram in early modern era consider cognition as a understanding uniquely owned by mind. Which is a representation rather depended on perception. This overturns the old idea of space constructed by locale, transforming into a *priori* whole of all potential understanable location. Such devision appose reason and perception, concept and reality. But they are also contradictory due to the paradox of deduction from reason to reality in *priori*.

Like Kant, the spontaneity of concept understanding is through the acceptance of perceptual intuition. The active cognition is through passive perception. For this reason, math can be decomposited to the general part derived from concept and intuition part stem form perception. And construction of math is a application by generality of concept to intuition. Thus pure reason degraded as the root of transcendental illusion due to the application beyond perception category.

Finally, in third stage, the culmintation of modernity of science, the comprehesion through and in concepts. Once we comprehend concepts,that's, the sense that reveal them. Admitting the objectivity of perception but not the necessity of relation to the object, or _thing_. This means concepts isn't merely form but also the material, with the referent and sense. Away from Kant, rather, we perceive concepts.

Sense as (something) isn't equal to sense itself. Perceive an object with a categorical state F is not perceive it as F directly. However, introspection is just a direct result of extrospection by perceiving our internal mind state. Even though it's mediated by language, but it doesn't mean thought is depended on language, just like extrosepction is mediated by sense doesn't mean the reality is depended on sense. 

Skepticism accepts the myth of epistemology *giveness*: it must assume that representation is given by certain concept structure to question the _given_ relation between representation and reality. But suppose a given representation with concept structure is already suppose too much.

If concept can be perceived, then following the judgement of Hume is heuristic, that habit affect by 

Usually, nominalist consider the _red thing_ doesn't exist because it's not a _thing_. Even though "red thing" isn't a thing, we can still comprehend that a "thing" is "red". So "red thing" isn't two referent as _red_ and _thing_, "red" as a token doesn't refer to red property, but rather concatenate with "thing" to inscribe the whole perception of "red" concept into "thing". For example, it indicates, like we paint the "thing" red.

It reveals that the abstraction of predicates from expression is a mistake. There's no abstraction instance which called property exists and beyond language, acquire a independence from it and reside in ontology. Or even worse, independent of thought. Just like Marx said, ideal is nothing more than material that has been introduced into the human mind and transformed within human brain. It should be clear that semantics isn't independent of such *picturing* functionality of concept, much more than this, *picturing* itself isn't semantics just like thought isn't language but mediated by it.

In conclusion, The underlying layer of language, consists of connections of patterns between concept object and physical object. And meaning is such dispatch by *picturing* between words, rather mystical ontology relation between reality and language. We can say the referent of Human as a referent to concept is a connections between the physical, historical practice of *Human* one could dispatch and the various language pattern of "Human". 

So we deduce in the base of concept, reveal defects from it. Logic is the concepts of concepts(it's not a recursive just like your sense yourself but can only filled in such single internal state.). Such logic fallibilism suggests that concepts has no guarantee and responsibility to reality because it's a hollow possibility through out *picturing*. Thus even math doesn't stem from sense of reality, it can be fallible. 

The classical mechanics derived from the basic knowledge of space and absolute time, and centuried atomism of Democritus, as mass point. We can see such _illusion_ mislead possible cognition of physicist as reduction through out all possible material. Until such singularity of atom transforms, into a complementarity between wave and particle.

Also, it should be denoted that the practise of physicist on "atom" concept also enrich it, by math terminology.
