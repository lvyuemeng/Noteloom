# AxEmbassy-Measure

We consider embassy task instance, which is async as same work unit as native thread.

Thus we let them do same work, measure the deviation from the expected sleep time as the standard.

```rust
(async) fn busy_work(iters: u64) -> u64 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for _ in 0..iters {
        total = black_box(total + 1);
        total = black_box(total * 3 / 2);
		(yield_now.await)
    }
    black_box(total)
}
```

Above code is the busy work each thread/task need to do. With `yield_now` as a `await` point to fully exploit the mechanism of async.

We code a macro to adapt this, with a `sleep_fn` to sleep, and measure the time elapsed denoted as `actual`(The time elapsed in each iteration) and `full`(The time elapsed between the last and current iteration)

```rust
macro_rules! task_loop {
	...
        loop {
            let iter_start = Instant::now();
            cnt += 1;

            if $busy_iters > 0 {
                let busy_start = Instant::now();
                let _res = black_box($busy_work($busy_iters));
                let busy_dur = Instant::now() - busy_start;
                log::info!(
                    "{} {}: duration {}/ns",
                    $task_type,
                    $id,
                    busy_dur.as_nanos()
                )
            }

            $sleep_fn($millis)$(.$await_tt)?;

            let iter_end = Instant::now();
            let iter_dur = iter_end - iter_start;
            let full_dur = iter_end - last_report;

            log::info!(
                "{} {}: Iteration {}, expected {}/ns, actual {}/ns, full {}/ns",
                $task_type,
                $id,
                cnt,
                millis.as_nanos(),
                iter_dur.as_nanos(),
                full_dur.as_nanos(),
            );

            last_report = iter_end;
        }
}
```

- The experiment is created to execute within 5 threads and 5 tasks. Numbered from 1 to 5 as `id`, which also as the argument of sleep seconds. `actual` and `full` elapsed time as the execution time of the work unit.

- Each work unit will implement `busy_work` with a same iterations as metric. After a fixed 15 seconds sleep time in `main` thread, we finish our record.

- Experiments is recorded in `0`, `1_000`, `1_000_000`. Then we dispose each to acquire `Mean Deviaton` which is the deviation from standard sleep time, `standard deviation`, `min`, `max`.

Here the acquired raw data:

- Iteration 0:

Here, we summarize the `Mean Deviation` as the metric, to display charts:

- Iteration 0:
![iteration 0](charts/Iter_0.png)
- Iteration 1_000:
![iteration 1_000](charts/Iter_1000.png)
- Iteration 1_000_000:
![iteration 1_000_000](charts/Iter_1_000_000.png)

We see that task switch would be quicker than thread, As the difference of `actual_ns` and `full_ns`. And with a better performances roughly 3-3.5 times better on scheduling.

Indeed, we can summarize all to form a line chart.

![iteration summary](charts/In_Iter.png)

Indeed this is a great advance compared to thread. Roughly, we test maximal to 100_000_000 iterations, in which we check that:

![iteration 100_000_000](charts/Iter_100_000_000.png)

We see that each maintains its step pace or slope in line graph. After this, any 10 times more would consume times longer than 15 seconds, which is beyond our test boundary.
